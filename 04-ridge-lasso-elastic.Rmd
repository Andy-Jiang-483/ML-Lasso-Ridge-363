### Load packages

```{r load-packages, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(tidyverse) 
library(tidymodels)
```

```{r split dataset into two}
music<- read.csv("music.csv",header = TRUE)

set.seed(7)

music_split <- initial_split(music, prop=0.5)
music_split

music_test <- testing(music_split)

music_train <- training(music_split)
```

As we can see, there are 73 variables in both the training and the testing dataset. Both have 250 observations each.
